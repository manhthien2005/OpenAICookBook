Check the documentation [here](https://distilabel.argilla.io/latest/).\n","\n","To evaluate the responses, we will use the [serverless HF Inference API](https://huggingface.co/docs/api-inference/index) integrated with distilabel. This is free but rate-limited, allowing you to test and evaluate over 150,000 public models, or your own private models, via simple HTTP requests, with fast inference hosted on Hugging Face shared infrastructure. If you need more compute power, you can deploy your own inference endpoint with [Hugging Face Inference Endpoints](https://huggingface.co/docs/inference-endpoints/guides/create_endpoint).\n","\n","Finally, to further curate the data, we will use [Argilla](https://github.com/argilla-io/argilla), which allows us to provide human feedback on the data quality. Argilla is a collaboration tool for AI engineers and domain experts who need to build high-quality datasets for their projects.
